# TicTacToeCoursework

Year 1 Semester 1 Coursework

We were tasked to create a TicTacToe game that can be played from the command line. The game should be played in single player and multi player
mode, and should be able to save a game and load a game. The task was to implement this game in Python.

I confirm that the work here is my own.

Lecturer feedback has also been attached. The coursework was marked 85/100.
